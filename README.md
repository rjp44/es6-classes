# Modern Javascript Class Examples

Just a set of examples I wrote to demonstrate ES2015/ES6 classes for my GirlsCodeMK Workshop.

Not much to see here, but:

**thing.js**: module which implements a Thing Superclass, only has one property: _**colour**_

**testThing.js**: creates two instances of Thing and dumps them to console.

**shapes.js**: implements twoDShape and threeDshape subclasses of Thing, and then Circle, Square, Cube, Globe subclasses.

**testShapes.js**: creates instances of all the different shapes and dumps them to console.

## Challenge
Clone this repo and then add the definition of a Cone class to shapes.js, instantiate it in testShapes.js
